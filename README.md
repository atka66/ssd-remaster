# Super Sonic Doom - Remastered

## The project

Super Sonic Doom is a megawad created by Stephen "The Ultimate DooMer" Clark. The overall look and feel of Doom is still there, but elements from Sonic the Hedgehog games are added, such as springs, monitors, and even special stages.

The original megawad was made for an older version of ZDoom and the implementations of some features are obscolete since. With today's ZDoom versions the game really shows its age with strange visual glitches and - sometimes even gamebreaking - functional bugs.

The project tries to fix these issues and makes the megawad playable on newer versions of ZDoom without functional faults.
